# Tumor Mutation Burden
Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is defined as the total number of mutations per coding area. Higher TMB corresponds to an increase in cancer-fighting T cells inciting an anti-tumor response. The project tries to integrate multiple skin cancer studies, normalize the TMB in different studies and build a R Shiny app, Tumor Mutation Burden Viewer, to help users explore the changes of TMB with various clinical and genomic variables.
